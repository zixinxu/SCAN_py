The current version is for simulation and reconstruction with a known probe. You can start by cloning the repo and revising the demos following the comments inside.

- SCAN_CDI_recon: for CDI reconstruction

- - image: simple cases of ground truth 
  - demo: simulation and reconstruction

- SCAN_Pty_recon: for Ptychography reconstruction

- - 2d_probe: Assume a known probe
  - SCANptycho: demo of ptychography simulation and reconstruction by SCAN
